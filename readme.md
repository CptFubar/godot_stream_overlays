# Godot Streaming Overlays

⚠️ Everything is subject to change as I'm actively working on it! ⚠️

This is a collection of various overlays, made from streaming, with Godot! I'm making them live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mreliptik)

## Projects

### Characters overlay

Similar to [Stream avatars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/665300/Stream_Avatars/) where you have characters on screen, representing your current viewers.

### Facecam overlay

An overlay made to replace your webcam. You can use different images (mouth open/closed) to change based on the mic input.

### Spectrum analyzer

Using the microphone (or any other audio stream) display a spectrum analyzer (frequency analysis).

## HOW TO USE

Each project is using a transparent window, so you can set it to the size you want and capture it with your streaming software. 

- For example with OBS, just setup a "Game Capture" source, and check "Allow Transparency" and voilà!

*TODO: Add specific directions for each projects*
